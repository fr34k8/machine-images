Install a debian package (a `.deb`). These can be built with sbt-native-pacakger(
http://www.scala-sbt.org/sbt-native-packager/formats/debian.html).

This script downloads and installs the package assuming the download 
location of the package is based on the tags of the instance and Riff-Raff's upload
conventions).

For further details have a look at the install script.
