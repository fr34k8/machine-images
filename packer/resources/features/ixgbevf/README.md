Enhanced networking for Ubuntu Vivid
====================================

This builds and installs a more up to date version of the ixgbevf network driver
which is used by many of the larger AWS instance types.

See http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/enhanced-networking.html
for more details as to why this is required.

We keep a copy of the tarball as sourceforge is unreliable.
